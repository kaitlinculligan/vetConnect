# VetConnect

VetConnect is a brand new web application. Through this platform users can book an appointment with a veterinarian doctor or have them visit your place. Vets will be able to register on our platform and indicate their date, time and availability. Users will also be able to register an account to book an appointment and keep a track of their appointment history and special notes (if any) by their vet, get suggestions for next appointment with the same vet in future and much more. 

VetConnect will have a calendar interface for booking an appointment which will make the UI attractive as well as have great functionality, the selected date and time will then be matched with our database for available vets at that exact date and time. User will also be able to have the vet visit their place by indicating it in the same booking process. When matched, the user will be able to continue with the booking by making a payment through the STRIPE payment gateway.

Upon successful payment the customer as well as the vet will get a notification for confirmation of the appointment with details like date and time. If the customer has a registered account he/she will be able to get a copy of confirmation in case they misplaced it.

The vet interface will keep a track of all the upcoming appointments for a particular vet and will have the ability to cancel, reschedule or message the customer. The vet interface will also have the functionality to change their availability on the system that will reflect on the customer side.
